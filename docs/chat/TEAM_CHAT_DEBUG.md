## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "No authenticated user found"
**Cause:** User is not logged in  
**Fix:** 
1. Go to `/login`
2. Login with your credentials
3. Go back to `/team-chat`

---

### Issue 2: "Error loading profile"
**Cause:** Profile doesn't exist in database  
**Fix:** Check Supabase profiles table
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT id, full_name, role FROM profiles WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

---

### Issue 3: "Unknown User" in Chat
**Cause:** Chat member data not loading  
**Fix:**

2. Selected a team member from the list
3. Check console for errors

---

### Issue 4: Page stuck on "Loading your profile..."

- Profile doesn't exist
- RLS policies blocking access

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
2. Verify profile exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
   ```
3. Check RLS policies allow SELECT on profiles table

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### 1. Check if you're logged in
```javascript
// In browser console:
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
console.log('Current user:', data.user)
```

### 2. Check if profile exists
```javascript
// In browser console:
const { data } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*').eq('id', 'YOUR_USER_ID').single()
console.log('Profile:', data)
```

### 3. Check team members loading
```javascript
// In browser console:
const { data } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*').in('role', ['teacher', 'admin', 'agent'])
console.log('Team members:', data)
```

VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID', 'Your Name', 'admin')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE 
SET full_name = 'Your Name', role = 'admin';
```

### Fix 2: Check RLS policies
```sql
-- Verify profiles table allows SELECT
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'profiles';
```

### Fix 3: Reset and test
1. Logout ‚Üí Login again
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Go to Team Chat
4. Check console logs

## üí° Tips
