# Public Team Chat - Simple Setup

## ✅ What I Built

**Simple public group chat** where ALL staff (admins, teachers, agents) can chat together in one room!

### Key Features:
- 💬 **One chat room** for everyone
- 🔄 **Real-time messaging** - instant updates
- 👥 **Role badges** - see who's who (👑 Admin, 🎧 Agent, 👨‍🏫 Teacher)
- 📱 **Simple & clean** - no complex room selection
- ⚡ **Just works** - like a public group chat

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database SQL

**Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:**
```sql
-- File: db/public_team_chat.sql
-- This creates ONE simple table: team_messages
```

This:
- ✅ Drops old complex tables
- ✅ Creates simple `team_messages` table
- ✅ Sets up permissions for staff

---

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop (Ctrl+C) and restart:
npm run dev
```

---

### Step 3: Test!

1. **Go to Team Chat** (`/team-chat`)
2. **See the chat interface** (no selection needed!)
3. **Type a message**
4. **Press Send** 📤
5. **Everyone sees it instantly!** ✅

## 💬 How It Works

### Simple Structure:

```
Everyone sees ONE chat room
   ↓
Type message
   ↓
