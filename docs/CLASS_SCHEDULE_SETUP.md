## üìä Useful Queries

### Get Teacher's Schedule for a Day

```sql
SELECT * FROM class_schedule_details
WHERE teacher_id = 'teacher-uuid-here'
  AND day_of_week = 1 -- Monday
  AND is_active = true
ORDER BY start_time;
```

### Get Student's Weekly Schedule

```sql
SELECT * FROM student_class_view
WHERE student_id = 'student-uuid-here'
  AND enrollment_status = 'enrolled'
ORDER BY day_of_week, start_time;
```

### Get Attendance Report for a Class

```sql
SELECT 
    s.full_name as student_name,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ar.status = 'present') as present_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ar.status = 'absent') as absent_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ar.status = 'late') as late_count,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ar.status = 'present')::DECIMAL / 
        COUNT(*)::DECIMAL * 100, 
        2
    ) as attendance_percentage
FROM class_enrollments ce
JOIN profiles s ON ce.student_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN attendance_records ar ON ar.student_id = ce.student_id
LEFT JOIN class_sessions cs ON ar.class_session_id = cs.id 
    AND cs.class_schedule_id = ce.class_schedule_id
WHERE ce.class_schedule_id = 'schedule-uuid-here'
  AND ce.enrollment_status = 'enrolled'
GROUP BY s.id, s.full_name
ORDER BY s.full_name;
```

### Check for Schedule Conflicts

```sql
SELECT cs1.*, cs2.id as conflicting_schedule_id
FROM class_schedules cs1
JOIN class_schedules cs2 ON 
    cs1.teacher_id = cs2.teacher_id
    AND cs1.day_of_week = cs2.day_of_week
    AND cs1.id != cs2.id
    AND cs1.academic_term_id = cs2.academic_term_id
WHERE (
    (cs1.start_time, cs1.end_time) OVERLAPS (cs2.start_time, cs2.end_time)
)
AND cs1.is_active = true
AND cs2.is_active = true;
```

## üîß Integration with Existing System

### Using Existing Tables

The schema integrates with your existing tables:

1. **`auth.users`** - Used for teacher_id and student_id references
2. **`profiles`** - Links to user profiles for names and roles
3. **`departments`** - Subjects can be assigned to departments

### Role Integration

The schema respects your existing roles:
- `admin` - Full access to all class management
- `agent` - Full access to all class management
- `teacher` - Can manage their own classes
- `user` - Can enroll and view their own schedules

You may want to add a `student` role if needed:

```sql
-- Update the profiles role check constraint
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_role_check;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_role_check 
    CHECK (role IN ('user','student','teacher','agent','admin'));
```

## üé® Frontend Integration Tips

### Fetching Student's Schedule

```javascript
import { supabase } from './supabaseClient'

async function getStudentSchedule(studentId) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('student_class_view')
    .select('*')
    .eq('student_id', studentId)
    .eq('enrollment_status', 'enrolled')
    .order('day_of_week')
    .order('start_time')
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching schedule:', error)
    return null
  }
  
  return data
}
```

### Fetching Teacher's Classes

```javascript
async function getTeacherClasses(teacherId) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('class_schedule_details')
    .select('*')
    .eq('teacher_id', teacherId)
    .eq('is_active', true)
    .order('day_of_week')
    .order('start_time')
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching classes:', error)
    return null
  }
  
  return data
}
```

### Real-time Subscriptions

Enable real-time updates for class schedules:

```javascript
// Subscribe to class schedule changes
const scheduleSubscription = supabase
  .channel('class-schedules')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'class_schedules'
    },
    (payload) => {
      console.log('Schedule updated:', payload)
      // Refresh your UI
    }
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## üß™ Testing the Setup

### 1. Test Basic Operations

```sql
-- Create a test term
INSERT INTO academic_terms (name, start_date, end_date, is_current)
VALUES ('Test Term', CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '3 months', true)
RETURNING *;

-- Create a test subject
INSERT INTO subjects (code, name, credits)
VALUES ('TEST101', 'Test Subject', 3)
RETURNING *;
```

### 2. Test RLS Policies

Login as different users and verify:
- Students can only see their own enrollments
- Teachers can manage their own classes
- Admins have full access

### 3. Test Constraints

Try to insert invalid data and verify constraints work:
```sql
-- Should fail: end_time before start_time
INSERT INTO class_schedules (
    subject_id, teacher_id, academic_term_id,
    day_of_week, start_time, end_time
)
VALUES (
    'subject-id', 'teacher-id', 'term-id',
    1, '10:00:00', '09:00:00'
);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "relation already exists"
**Solution:** Tables might already exist. Drop them first:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS attendance_records CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS class_sessions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS class_enrollments CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS class_announcements CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS class_schedules CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS office_hours CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subjects CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS academic_terms CASCADE;
```

#### Issue: "foreign key constraint violated"
**Solution:** Ensure referenced tables exist (departments, auth.users, profiles)

#### Issue: RLS blocking queries
**Solution:** Check your user's role in the profiles table:
```sql
SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Create a Schedule UI** - Build React components to display schedules
2. **Add Calendar View** - Integrate with calendar libraries (FullCalendar, React Big Calendar)
3. **Email Notifications** - Send reminders for upcoming classes
4. **Mobile App** - Create mobile views for students/teachers
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - Track attendance, enrollment trends
6. **Export Features** - Allow exporting schedules to PDF/iCal

---

## ü§ù Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in your dashboard
2. Verify all tables were created successfully
3. Ensure RLS policies are enabled
4. Check user roles in the profiles table
