# Fix Ticket Display in Live Activity

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Ugly Ticket ID Format
**Before:** `#TK-0825bb2f-7b8c-4b62-b7e1-d083c9070b09` (full UUID)  
**After:** `#TK-9070B09` (last 6 chars, uppercase)

### Issue 2: No Ticket Title Shown
**Before:** Only showed user and action, no context about what the ticket was about  
**After:** Shows ticket title below the activity

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Ticket ID Format**
Changed from using full UUID to last 6 characters in uppercase:
```javascript
// Before
target: `#TK-${String(newTicket.id).padStart(6, '0')}`
// Would show: #TK-0825bb2f-7b8c-4b62-b7e1-d083c9070b09

// After
target: `#TK-${newTicket.id.slice(-6).toUpperCase()}`
// Now shows: #TK-9070B09
```

### 2. **Added Ticket Title**
Now stores and displays the ticket title:
```javascript
{
  ticketId: newTicket.id,
  ticketTitle: newTicket.title  // ‚Üê Added this
}
```

### 3. **Updated LiveActivity Component**
Shows ticket title in a secondary line with styling:
```javascript
<div className="activity-main">
  <span>User X created ticket #TK-9070B09</span>
</div>
<div className="activity-ticket-title">
  "Computer Freezing"  ‚Üê Shows ticket title
</div>
```

## üìù Technical Details

### Ticket ID Generation
- Uses last 6 characters of UUID
- Converted to uppercase for readability
- Format: `#TK-XXXXXX`
- Example UUIDs:
  - `0825bb2f-7b8c-4b62-b7e1-d083c9070b09` ‚Üí `#TK-9070B09`
  - `abc12345-6789-0abc-def1-234567890abc` ‚Üí `#TK-890ABC`

### Why Last 6 Characters?
1. **Unique Enough**: UUIDs have high entropy at the end
2. **Readable**: Short enough to read at a glance
3. **Recognizable**: Uppercase makes it stand out
4. **Copy-Friendly**: Easy to copy/paste for searching

### Database Query
Added `title` field to the query:
```javascript
.select(`
  id,
  title,        // ‚Üê Added
  created_at,
  // ... other fields
`)
```
