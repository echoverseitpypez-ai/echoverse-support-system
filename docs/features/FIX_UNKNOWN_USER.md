# Fix "Unknown User" in Live Activity - Solution

## üêõ The Problem

Live Activity was showing "Unknown User" when tickets were created because:
1. The `profiles` table didn't have an `email` column
2. Some users had empty `full_name` in their profile
3. No fallback mechanism to show at least the user's email address

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration

**Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

Open the file: `db/fix_profiles_email.sql` and execute it in Supabase SQL Editor.

This will:
- ‚úÖ Add `email` column to `profiles` table
- ‚úÖ Update existing profiles with email from `auth.users`
- ‚úÖ Update the `handle_new_user()` trigger to automatically include email
- ‚úÖ Create an `on_auth_user_updated` trigger to sync email changes
- ‚úÖ Set `full_name` fallback to email if not provided

### Step 2: Code Changes (Already Applied)

I've updated the code to use a fallback chain:
1. Try `full_name` first
2. If empty, use `email`
3. If both empty, show "Unknown User"

**Updated in `EnhancedAdminDashboard.jsx`:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time INSERT handler now fetches both `full_name` and `email`
- ‚úÖ `loadInitialActivities()` now fetches both fields
- ‚úÖ Better error handling with console warnings

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Existing Users
1. Run the SQL migration
2. Refresh the admin dashboard
3. Check Live Activity - should show user emails instead of "Unknown User"

### Test 2: New Ticket
1. Create a new ticket as any user
2. Check admin dashboard Live Activity
3. Should show the user's name or email within 1-2 seconds

### Test 3: New User
1. Create a new account
2. Submit a ticket
3. Should show at least the email address in Live Activity

## üìã What Gets Displayed Now

**Priority Order:**
1. **Full Name** - If user has set their full name
2. **Email Address** - If full name is empty
3. **"Unknown User"** - Only if both are somehow empty (very rare)

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "John Doe created ticket #TK-000123" (has full name)
- ‚úÖ "john@example.com created ticket #TK-000124" (email fallback)
- ‚ùå "Unknown User created ticket..." (should never happen now)

## üîç Verification

After running the SQL migration, verify:

```sql
-- Check that all profiles have email
SELECT id, full_name, email, role 
FROM public.profiles 
WHERE email IS NULL;
-- Should return 0 rows

-- Check that profiles match auth users
SELECT 
  p.id,
  p.full_name,
  p.email as profile_email,
  u.email as auth_email,
  CASE 
    WHEN p.email = u.email THEN '‚úÖ Match'
    ELSE '‚ùå Mismatch'
  END as status
FROM public.profiles p
JOIN auth.users u ON p.id = u.id
LIMIT 10;
-- All should show "‚úÖ Match"
```

## üéØ Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
Just now
Unknown User created ticket#TK-0825bb2f-7b8c-4b62-b7e1-d083c9070b09
```

### After Fix:
```
Just now
john.doe@example.com created ticket#TK-000123
```

or if full name is set:
```
Just now
John Doe created ticket#TK-000123
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Unknown User"?

**Check 1: SQL Migration Ran Successfully**
```sql
-- Verify email column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'email';
-- Should return 1 row
```

**Check 2: Trigger is Active**
```sql
-- Check trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name IN ('on_auth_user_created', 'on_auth_user_updated');
-- Should return 2 rows
```

**Check 3: Browser Console**
- Open admin dashboard
- Press F12 to open console
- Create a ticket
- Look for warnings like "Profile not found" or "Error fetching creator details"

**Check 4: Clear Cache**
- Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Or clear browser cache completely

### Profile doesn't have email after migration?

Manually update:
```sql
UPDATE public.profiles p
SET email = u.email
FROM auth.users u
WHERE p.id = u.id
AND p.email IS NULL;
```

## üìù Files Modified

1. **Created:** `db/fix_profiles_email.sql` - Database migration
2. **Updated:** `src/pages/EnhancedAdminDashboard.jsx` 
   - Enhanced real-time INSERT handler
   - Updated `loadInitialActivities()`
