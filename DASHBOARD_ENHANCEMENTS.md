## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Schedule state
const [scheduleToday, setScheduleToday] = useState([])
const [nextClass, setNextClass] = useState(null)
const [timeUntilNext, setTimeUntilNext] = useState(null)

// Notes state
const [notes, setNotes] = useState([])
const [noteInput, setNoteInput] = useState('')
const [editingNoteId, setEditingNoteId] = useState(null)
```

### Key Functions
- `toPHTime(hhmm)` - Converts KST time to PH time
- `to12h(hhmm)` - Converts 24-hour format to 12-hour AM/PM format
- `timeAddMinutes(hhmm, minutes)` - Adds minutes to a time string
- `handleSaveNote()` - Saves or updates a note
- `handleDeleteNote(noteId)` - Deletes a note
- `handleEditNote(note)` - Loads note for editing
- `handleCancelEdit()` - Cancels editing mode

### Data Persistence
- **Schedule Data**: Loaded from `localStorage` key: `classSchedules:${userId}`
- **Notes Data**: Stored in `localStorage` key: `teacherNotes:${userId}`
- Both are user-specific and persist across sessions

### Real-Time Updates
- Countdown timer updates every 1 second using `setInterval`
- Automatically recalculates next class when schedule changes
- Cleans up intervals on component unmount

## UI/UX Highlights

### Design Elements
- **Color Coding**: Classes use custom colors with 15% opacity backgrounds
- **Icons**: Calendar and Note icons for visual clarity
- **Typography**: Monospace fonts for times, proper font weights for hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using CSS variables
- **Borders**: Left border accent on class cards, subtle borders on notes
- **Gradients**: Gradient background for countdown timer
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions on interactive elements

### Responsive Layout
- 2-column grid for widgets (cols-2)
- Proper gap spacing between widgets
- Scrollable content areas where needed
- Flexible layouts that adapt to content

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear labels and placeholders
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter)
