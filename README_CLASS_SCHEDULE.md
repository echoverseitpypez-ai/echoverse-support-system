## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Deploy Schema

**Option A - Supabase Dashboard (Recommended):**
1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `db/class_schedule_schema.sql`
4. Paste and Run

**Option B - Deployment Script:**
```bash
node scripts/deploy-class-schedule.js
```

### Step 2: Create Sample Data

```sql
-- Create a term
INSERT INTO academic_terms (name, start_date, end_date, is_current)
VALUES ('Fall 2025', '2025-09-01', '2025-12-20', true);

-- Create a subject
INSERT INTO subjects (code, name, credits, color)
VALUES ('CS101', 'Intro to Computer Science', 3, '#3498db');

-- Create a class (replace UUIDs with actual values)
INSERT INTO class_schedules (
    subject_id, teacher_id, academic_term_id,
    day_of_week, start_time, end_time, room, max_students
)
VALUES (
    '<subject-uuid>', '<teacher-uuid>', '<term-uuid>',
    1, '09:00', '10:30', 'Room 101', 30
);
```

### Step 3: Use the React Component

```javascript
import ClassScheduleExample from './components/ClassScheduleExample'

function App() {
  return <ClassScheduleExample />
}
```

---

## üìä Useful Queries

### Get Student's Schedule
```sql
SELECT * FROM student_class_view
WHERE student_id = '<user-id>'
ORDER BY day_of_week, start_time;
```

### Get Teacher's Classes
```sql
SELECT * FROM class_schedule_details
WHERE teacher_id = '<user-id>'
AND is_active = true;
```

### Check Attendance Rate
```sql
SELECT 
    student_id,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'present') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as attendance_rate
FROM attendance_records
WHERE class_session_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM class_sessions WHERE class_schedule_id = '<schedule-id>'
)
GROUP BY student_id;
```

---

## üé® Frontend Integration

### Fetching Data
```javascript
// Get schedule
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('class_schedule_details')
  .select('*')
  .eq('is_active', true)

// Real-time updates
supabase
  .channel('schedules')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'class_schedules' },
    (payload) => console.log('Schedule updated!', payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

### Creating Classes
```javascript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('class_schedules')
  .insert({
    subject_id: subjectId,
    teacher_id: userId,
    academic_term_id: termId,
    day_of_week: 1, // Monday
    start_time: '09:00:00',
    end_time: '10:30:00',
    room: 'Room 101',
    max_students: 30
  })
```

---

## üìà Performance

### Indexes Created
- Teacher lookups
- Subject lookups
- Day of week filtering
- Date range queries
- Student enrollment searches
- Attendance tracking

### Optimized Views
- `class_schedule_details` - Full schedule with joins
- `student_class_view` - Student-specific view
- `teacher_class_view` - Teacher statistics

---

## üîÑ Automatic Features

### Triggers
- **Updated timestamps** - Auto-update `updated_at` on changes
- **Enrollment counting** - Auto-update `enrolled_count` when students enroll/drop

### Constraints
- Valid time ranges (end_time > start_time)
- Valid day_of_week (0-6)
- Positive capacity
- Unique enrollments (no duplicate enrollments)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Fields

```sql
-- Example: Add prerequisite field to subjects
ALTER TABLE subjects
ADD COLUMN prerequisite_id UUID REFERENCES subjects(id);
```

### Custom Views

```sql
-- Example: View for conflict detection
CREATE VIEW schedule_conflicts AS
SELECT cs1.*, cs2.id as conflicting_with
FROM class_schedules cs1
JOIN class_schedules cs2 ON 
    cs1.teacher_id = cs2.teacher_id
    AND cs1.day_of_week = cs2.day_of_week
    AND cs1.id != cs2.id
WHERE (cs1.start_time, cs1.end_time) OVERLAPS (cs2.start_time, cs2.end_time);
```

---

## üì± Mobile Considerations

The schema supports mobile apps with:
- UUID primary keys for offline sync
- Timestamps for conflict resolution
- Efficient indexes for quick queries
- Views for reduced data transfer

---

## üß™ Testing

### Verify Installation
```sql
-- Check if all tables exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
    'academic_terms', 'subjects', 'class_schedules', 
    'class_enrollments', 'class_sessions', 'attendance_records',
    'class_announcements', 'office_hours'
);
-- Should return 8
```

### Test RLS
```sql
-- As a student, try to view another student's enrollments
-- Should return no results or error
SELECT * FROM class_enrollments WHERE student_id != auth.uid();
```
